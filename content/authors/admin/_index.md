Fang Liu is an assistant professor of chemistry at Stanford University. Her reserach is focused on the light induced dynamics of solid low dimensional materials and construction of low dimensional artificial structures. Prior to her current position, she was a DOE Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) postdoctoral fellow in the group of Prof. Xiaoyang Zhu at Columbia University.  Her postdoctoral research focused on using femtosecond extreme UV in probing time and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy of 2D materials.  Prior to working in Columbia, she worked under the direction of Prof. Marsha I Lester at University of Pennsylvania. She received her Ph.D. in 2015 and worked as a postdoc in the same group in 2016.  At UPenn, she used time resolved spectroscopic techniques to study spectroscopy and photochemistry of Criegee intermediates.  She received her B.S. in chemistry at Peking University in 2010.
